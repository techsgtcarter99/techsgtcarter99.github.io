#Welcome to Daniel Holcomb's Github Page!

###A little about me, I started my education in software engineering back in 2018 with a graduation date in early 2022.  I have experience working with various languages such as C++, C#, SQL, JSON, and Python; however my strongest language is Python.  In my final class I took on a hard challenge to build a GUI in C# using Visual Studio 2022 that would utilize drop-down menus to navigate and at the end it would use JSON data to populate information for the user however the JSON part is still having issues.  I have provided screenshots of my code and a bit about how it works below.  Enjoy!

*This code shows that under the click function of the button, that we are retrieving the strings from the three drop-down menus and then we are asking, if they each equal this text then we want the program to go to a certain window.*

*This code is once again retrieving the strings from a drop-down menu to go to the next window to go to the final window while also having a return button to go back to the last window incase the user has picked the wrong data.*

*This is where the JSON data is suppose to display in the text box however having issues with that so I put the text in the text box itself to get it to display.*

**Thank you and I hope you enjoyed this little insight on my project, please check out my others and I will continue to update this page as I grow in this career field!**
